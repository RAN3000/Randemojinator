        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Randemojinator is a website created by me, 17-year-old Giacomo Randazzo.
        I was one day playing around with the Pokemon fusion generator website and I thought:
        "Why not to make the same thing but for emojis?". So I started eding emojis manually
        to get out all the face elements. I then design the website while I was teaching how to code
        to a friend of mine, Andrea Zaninelli. It took around a month to set everything up and
        then I deployed.
        So there it is: Randemojinator.co - Generate cool, randomized emojis in just one tap.</p>
